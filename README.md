Background
==========
Enrich 911 emergency incident data to provide better analytics for a fire department. Try to utilize best practices where possible given available time.

Task
----
Develop a backend API for fetching incident data that are enriched with additional information.  A front-end developer should be expected to be able to use this backend to display incidents on a map for potential inspection by a user.  

Enrichments
-----------
* Weather at the time of the incident (use a weather service of your choice, but https://dev.meteostat.net/ does include free historical queries).

Integration Test
----------------
You need to implement integrations tests for the API

Notes
-----
* Example incidents are provided in the data folder.
* We will test the project with an arbitrary incident file(s) that is also from Richmond, VA and in the same format.
* We would like for you to spend up to 4 hours. It is okay if you spend less time or more time so long as you submit within 24 hours from receiving the project.
* Use technology stack of your choice.

Deliverable
-----------
* Link to a Github repository with your commits as you originally made them. Do not squash them or just have a single commit.
* There should be a README in the repo with the following section:
    * Steps to install and run your app. Assume the user will be on OSX but if you do not have access to OSX machine, provide needed steps to run your app on any other OS.
    * Steps to run the integration tests
    * What improvements would you make or best practices would you utilize if you had double the time?
    * About how much time did you spend on the project?
* If you completed the project, add a few screenshots to the repo that show the working version as running on your machine.
